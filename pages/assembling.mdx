Note:
- You can only run the car if the batter is charged, use a USB cable to charge it (takes approximately 1 hour)
- Make sure the Servo Pin is connected to pin 9
- When assembling the holders for the wheels, make sure it goes through 
- To make it easy, run the code first and make sure the FRONT for the orange motor is 90, then attach it to the steering wheels, so that the wheels
can turn full 90 degrees on either side (the turning degree does not go to negative)
- The car's speed when turning is slightly lower than going forward front
- Make sure to not lose any screws and nuts, as there are EXACTLY as many for the car 
- The time is in microseconds (1000 is 1 seconds)
- Speed is measured in rotation of motor

1. Assembling 
- Assemble the car as follows in the video: 
https://osoyoo.com/2021/02/20/sg90-servo-steering-robot-car-lesson-1-hardware-installation-and-servo-test/

+ Install the back motor
+ Install the bearings into the rod, then install the rods onto the board, making sure that the screws go through the holes that is blocked, the
holes that are not blocked are meant for the wheels
+ Peel off the white sticker on the UNO board, it makes it easier to assemble the car when you can see through it
+ Install the circuit parts as follows in the video, make sure that the two front motors are installed on different sides, the blue one is installed
up, while the orange one is installed down
+ The sensor is installed upside down, so it faces opposite the blue motor 

- For the Arduino board: 
+ Remove jumper caps on ENB-D6, IN3-D9, IN4-D10 
+ Connect back motor to either K1 or K2
+ Connect battery box to PWR1 (red box)
+ Connect volt meter to Motor Shield V1.1
+ Connect orange motor to D9 
+ Connect blue motor to D10 
+ Connect tracker sensor, with 7 pins, to Motor Shield V1.1 (7 blue pins on top right corner)
+ Connect ultrasound sensor, with 4 pins, to Motor Shield V1.1 


Here is how all the parts work: 
- The blue motor controls the ultrasound sensor (the cat face)
- The orange motor controls the steering of the wheels 
- The back motor controls the speed of the car (+ and -)
- The Arduino board is where all the commands go to
- The small board with 3 digits is the volt meter, measuring how much voltage is put in
