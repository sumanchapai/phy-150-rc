Note:
- You can only run the car if the batter is charged, use a USB cable to charge it (takes approximately 1 hour)
- Make sure the Servo Pin is connected to pin 9
- When assembling the holders for the wheels, make sure it goes through 
- To make it easy, run the code first and make sure the FRONT for the orange motor is 90, then attach it to the steering wheels, so that the wheels
can turn full 90 degrees on either side (the turning degree does not go to negative)
- The car's speed when turning is slightly lower than going forward front
- Make sure to not lose any screws and nuts, as there are EXACTLY as many for the car 
- The time is in microseconds (1000 is 1 seconds)
- Speed is measured in rotation of motor

1. Assembling 
- Assemble the car as follows in the video: 
https://osoyoo.com/2021/02/20/sg90-servo-steering-robot-car-lesson-1-hardware-installation-and-servo-test/

+ Install the back motor
+ Install the bearings into the rod, then install the rods onto the board, making sure that the screws go through the holes that is blocked, the
holes that are not blocked are meant for the wheels
+ Peel off the white sticker on the UNO board, it makes it easier to assemble the car when you can see through it
+ Install the circuit parts as follows in the video, make sure that the two front motors are installed on different sides, the blue one is installed
up, while the orange one is installed down
+ The sensor is installed upside down, so it faces opposite the blue motor 

- For the Arduino board: 
+ Remove jumper caps on ENB-D6, IN3-D9, IN4-D10 
+ Connect back motor to either K1 or K2
+ Connect battery box to Motor Shield V1.1
+ Connect volt meter to Motor Shield V1.1
+ Connect orange motor to D9 
+ Connect blue motor to D10 
+ Connect tracker sensor, with 7 pins, to Motor Shield V1.1 
+ Connect ultrasound sensor, with 4 pins, to Motor Shield V1.1 


Here is how all the parts work: 
- The blue motor controls the ultrasound sensor (the cat face)
- The orange motor controls the steering of the wheels 
- The back motor controls the speed of the car (+ and -)
- The Arduino board is where all the commands go to
- The small board with 3 digits is the volt meter, measuring how much voltage is put in

2. Steering test 
Download this code and open it in your Arduino IDE, connect it to your Arduino and upload it 
When you run this test, the car will face to the front at 90, turn left, and turn right, then faces front again.
Make sure the car's front orientates with the board. If it doesn't, slightly change 90 up or down until it faces the right direction.

3. Running the car 
- Properties for the car 
+ Mass: 405 grams without Wifi module, 410 grams with Wifi module
+ Max speed: 255, corresponding to 12.07 km/h
+ Min speed: 91, corresponding to 3.017 km/h, any lower values you have to nudge the car for it to move 
+ Wheel estimated coefficient of friction: Resting = 
+ Max weight the car can carry at max speed: 
+ Max slope the car can go:

Download this code and open it in your Arduino IDE, connect it to your Arduino and upload it 
- The car should go forward, go backward, turn right, then turn left, then stop

- You can play around with the code: 
+ Put the code in the void loop() section, and the car will repeat the actions 
+ Try making the car go in a loop
+ Test the car to see its maximum turning angle
+ See if the car can go over various obstacles
