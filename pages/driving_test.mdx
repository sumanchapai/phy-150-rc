Running the car 
Here are some physical properties of the car: 
- Mass: 405 grams without Wifi module, 410 grams with Wifi module
- Max speed: 255, corresponding to 12.07 km/h
- Min speed: 91, corresponding to 3.017 km/h, any lower values you have to nudge the car for it to move 
- Wheel estimated coefficient of rolling friction = 
- Max slope the car can go up: 

Code upload: 
- Copy this code and open it in your Arduino IDE

- Modify line 21 to make the car's FRONT accurate
- Connect it to your car and upload it
- The car should go forward, go backward, turn right, then turn left, then stop, with a 1s delay between each action 

- You can play around with the code: 
+ Put the code in the void loop() section, and the car will repeat the actions 
+ Try making the car go in a loop
