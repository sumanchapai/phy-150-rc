Here are some physical properties of the car: 
- Mass: 405 grams without Wifi module, 410 grams with Wifi module
- Max speed: analog value is 255, corresponding to 12.07 km/h
- Min speed: analog value is 91, corresponding to 3.017 km/h, any lower values you have to nudge the car for it to move 
- Wheel estimated coefficient of rolling friction = 
- Max slope the car can go up:

Copy this code and open it in your Arduino IDE
https://gist.github.com/minhviet0308/45b32dd6eb89d4b52c5bc8cc925e6c8c

- Modify line 21 to make the car's FRONT accurate
- Modify line 22 and 23 to adjust the right and left turning angles 
- Modify line 27 and 28 to adjust the normal and high speed of the car
- Connect it to your car and upload it

The car should go forward, go backward, turn right, then turn left, then stop, with a 1s delay between each action 

For fun: 
- Using the loop() function, can you make the car go in a circle? Go in an 8-shape?
