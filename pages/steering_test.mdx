When you run this test, the car will face to the front at 90, turn left, and turn right, then faces front again.

Note: 
- Line 6 is the most important line, it dictates the angle which the motor sees as the 'front' of the car 
- Make sure the car's front orientates with the board. If it doesn't, slightly change 90 up or down until it faces the right direction.
- Line 8 and 9 is the turning angles for left and right, change this however you like with respect to your front angle (ex: if you front is 90, then
your turning angles are 40 and 140)
