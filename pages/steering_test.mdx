Steering test 
Download this code and open it in your Arduino IDE, connect it to your Arduino and upload it 
When you run this test, the car will face to the front at 90, turn left, and turn right, then faces front again.
Make sure the car's front orientates with the board. If it doesn't, slightly change 90 up or down until it faces the right direction.
