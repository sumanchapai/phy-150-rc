# Projects 

Here are a couple of ideas for the kind of engineering projects you can perform now.

1. Measure coefficient of restitution of different kind of surfaces.
1. Measure maximum acceleration of the car as is (without external load) on a particular surface.
1. Measure maximum velocity of the car.
1. See how the acceleration decreases, if at all, as the speed of the car increases (primarily because of air resistance).
1. What's the maximum load that the car can carry?
1. What's the maximum slope that the car can travel. Try putting extra load if if can climb any ramp under no extra weight.
1. What physical structure can you change/add to make the car more aerodynamic?
