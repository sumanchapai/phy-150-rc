Line tracking: 
- Utilizes the front tracking sensor to sense the change in surface color 
- The car will tracks surface with darker colors 
- Put a black tape on the floor and the car will try to follow along that line of tape 

Download this code and open it in your Arduino IDE, connect it to your Arduino and upload it:

For fun: 
- At what speed does the car lose track of the line? That is, it goes too fast to follow along the line 
- Can the car do line tracking while going backwards?
