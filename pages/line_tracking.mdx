Line tracking: 
- Utilizes the front tracking sensor to sense the change in surface color 
- The car will tracks surface with darker colors 
- Put a black tape on the floor and the car will try to follow along that line of tape 

Note: 
- Put the car's speed to about 110, too fast and the car will not be able to react to turn 
- The car can track while going backward? Can it?
