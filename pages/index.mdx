# Building a car
 
Through this guide, we'll help you assemble the robot car you're provided with and hopefully that will set you up to do some engineering experiments on the car. Note that this guide is adapated from the contents in the official [Osoyoo guides](https://osoyoo.com/2021/02/20/sg90-servo-steering-robot-car-lesson-1-hardware-installation-and-servo-test).

## What you'll need

1. Latest version of [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed on your system.
1. The Osoyoo car kit.
1. You're ready to go.
